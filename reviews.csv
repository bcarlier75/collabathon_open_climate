1.0 out of 5 stars,"I pre-ordered the phone because amazon told me by chat that they were participing in the galaxy buds promotions of samsung. FAKE, I did not get anything, and now amazon and samsung are saying that is each other fault. They don't want to anything about it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"The phone was great at first. Then it started getting really hot and losing battery really fast. Eventually, it turned off and no matter what I did, I couldn't get it to charge back up. I was sent a replacement but unfortunately, the replacement was a blocked phone and I couldn't even use it. Never buying expensive tech from Amazon in the future.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"The thumbprint reader is located on the edge of the phone. Top right edge and it means that your phone cases need to have a large cut out right by the edge and every case made for this phone will be very weak right there. I guess it's only a design flaw in the sense that phone cases will be hard to make well for this phone. I personally never use the thumbprint reader. I wish this phone had it on the back or just didn't have one at all. Looking for a case that actually just covers this spot since I never use it and would prefer a good case.Ohterwise, amazing phone. Great camera. Very fast. Still has the headphone jack! It's smaller than anything else this nice. Got a lot of things going for this phone!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a beautiful phone. I've had 4 of the previous Galaxy phones, so I'm very well accumulated with Android and Samsung. Everyone knows how awesome android is and how superior Samsung screens are, they continue to get better each time. Unfortunately the screen is too sensitive to use without a case on it.  You simply can't n't hold the phone without your hands or fingers touching the edges and working against what you are actually trying to press. Once my otter box phone case arrive a day later, the problem was solved! Make sure you get all the full updates before adding your fingerprint.  Mine didn't work at all until the update. For whatever reason.Best phone yet!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this phone I was able to use either a pin number or fingerprint to open. I haven't activated face recognition. Everything loads so fast, nice voice recognition for hands free. I have dropped the phone twice both times onto tile floor without any damage. The charge share feature is great. Battery life is awesome and charging the battery is faster then any cellphone I have ever owned. The slim style is great in the hand or a pocket, fits in a front shirt pocket without weighing it down. Hard to believe that a cellphone can produce the great quality of pictures that it does. Lots of storage space with plenty of gb for files and apps. I would definitely recommend the S10 phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall I really like this phone. I was worried because of all the reviews saying their box was opened already, or they got the international version instead, overheating, etc.I've had no problems with this phone, I got the US version. No overheating. I did order directly from Amazon and not third party, so that is what I'd reccomend to ensure you're getting what you pay for; I've previously had an unlocked s8 that I've also ordered from Amazon and had no problems with that either.The only slight complaint I have is the fingerprint scanner. I give it 3 stars only because it doesn't unlock the phone instantly like it did with my s8, and you can't see exactly where to put your finger. But that's not a big deal to me personally, just a heads up if you're going to purchase.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"When I received the phone in box, I opened the box. Box was packed with sticker that can be removed easily. Usually, the sticker on the box is harder to remove and it create some kind of glue mark on the box when you removing it. Then I opened the box and I see that phone was just open with anything on it(no bag or bubble bag or pad that protects the screen. usually when you buy new phone, everything comes in proper packaging. USB C to USB connector was roaming inside box. it was not on its place. charger was not properly placed. charging cable is usually tide with wire tie. And in this one it was just came without it. Seems some one try to use this phone or some on tempered this phone. or it could be refurbished phone. never know.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"So my Samsung S7 took a dive and I needed to replace it ASAP.  I bought this ""refreshed"" S10 hoping that it wouldn't be full of scratches that I'd need to cover and it wasn't.  I know the features and am more than pleased with the upgraded device and I got it for a stellar price point.  No VZW payment plans for me!

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Do not buy this phone! I repeat DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE OR ANY PHONE FROM AMAZON. Amazon will not help you if you need this to be replaced if there is anything wrong with it. I purchased this phone as I loved it when I checked it out. My battery started giving me issues in dying within a few hours. I called in to Amazon while I was travelling on vacation and informed them about the issue. The girl said she made comments about this and as soon as I get back to the USA I can receive a replacement for this item. She created a replacement ticket and I informed her it's not a good idea to send me a phone now as I'll only be back in the US within 2months. The girl told me there will be no issues as soon as you get back give us a call. I just arrived back in the USA from my travels after a month and a half and a new person I spoke to explained to me that unfortunately its outside of the return date and unfortunately I will need to take this up with Samsung. Really Amazon!

3.0 out of 5 stars,"DO NOT repeat DO NOT get this phone if you are going to use it on the AT+T network AND you rely on WiFi calling. Which I do. According to AT+T it has no plans in the future to allow any unlocked phones to use WiFi calling, HD calling, VoLTE, or call protect. IT WILL NOT WORK. If you do not care about these features it is a great phone. I was forced to return it for the above reasons.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Hello everyone.I bought this device and was disappointedly disappointed.For some reason, the device came on one SIM-card, whereas the description doesnâ€™t say anything and there is no information, so by default all Samsung come with lots on two SIM-cards.My task in choosing this device was precisely in this, so that I had an expensive flagship with a large functional channel, and I had two SIM cards. Now it's just a piece of expensive iron.If there are solutions on this issue, tell me?If not, then I will have to go to the consumer rights society through lawsuits and thereby return the money spent to empty.I believe that this is consumer fraud.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"The 500GB phone has some weight compared to the 128GB. It's an excellent phone and i'm very happy with it. My one gripe is snapchat though. My phone has the ""Warning: Camera Failed"" issue like many S10+'s seem to have and i figured out that snapchat has been causing the issue for me. Out of all the fixes online, none seem to work and it's become an inconvience due to how much i use the camera for work. Other than that issue, the phone is great and i would recommend it.
